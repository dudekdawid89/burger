# Burger App

## About

1. **Burger** is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

2. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page - waiting to be devoured.

3. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
